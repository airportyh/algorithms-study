# Algorithms Study

This is a collection of code written for the purpose of learning certain algorithms
and data structures from *Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein*.

Some of the code examples use graphviz to generate visuals of the data structures.

## Todo

* Prim's minimum spanning tree algoritthm
* Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm
* label back edges for articulation point
* visualize strongly connect components

* strongly connected components (done)
* articulation points (done)
* debug/fix topological sort (done)
